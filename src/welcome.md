# Welcome to RustBridge!

No matter how you stumbled upon this project, this little page exists to guide
you in the right direction. There's a bit more information depending on what
you're interested in:

## I want to attend a RustBridge workshop!

Great! Unfortunately we currently lack a centralized directory of all RustBridge
events happening around the globe (although that would be really nice to have),
so for now your best bet is to have a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/rustbridge/team/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aevent">
  issues tagged with <code>event</code></a>, that's generally where all events that
  run under the RustBridge name are tracked, but it's not always reliable.

## I want to host my own RustBridge workshop!

Oh, fantastic! We've prepared a document just for you, you can have a look at it
[here](./organizing/index.md).
