# Team Tooling

## Discord

The main open discussion space for the RustBridge project is in the Rust
project Discord server. Discord is a chat platform that's easy to use
and available on most platforms. You can join the Discord server of the
Rust project by visiting [this link](https://discord.gg/rust-lang).

RustBridge has a channel called `#rustbridge`, which is categorized under the
"Community" section. If you use the `Ctrl/Cmd+K` shortcut and search for
RustBridge, you will find it. Feel free to ask questions and hang out!

## Airtable

Internally, most RustBridge events are centrally planned using [Airtable](http://airtable.com).
This gives us overview and flexibility over which events are happening where.
These sheets are not available to the public, as they contain potentially
private information. They're only visible to RustBridge team members and select
event organizers and teachers.

## GitHub

RustBridge uses GitHub to manage and publicly plan events, as well as develop
infrastructure around the project. Here's some interesting repositories:

- [team](https://github.com/rustbridge/team): This is where the team plans meetings
  and publicly announces RustBridge events.
- [in-a-box](https://github.com/rustbridge/in-a-box): A somewhat complete resource for
  RustBridge event organizers needing a curriculum, funding advice, et cetera.
- [book](https://github.com/rustbridge/book): The source to this book!
