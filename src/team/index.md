# RustBridge Team

The RustBridge team is comprised of individuals who whost RustBridge events,
work on tooling for RustBridge, and people who are just interested in improving
existing conditions under which events are organized.

The team is formally a sub-team of the [Rust Community Team](https://community.rs),
and the current team lead is [Olivia Hugger](https://awoo.su). This means that
RustBridge is fully integrated into the Rust project, which brings with it many
benefits such as cross-cutting team concerns and easier internal communication.
