# Team Meetings

RustBridge team meetings are nominally held every 2 weeks (alternating with the
Community Team meetings), at 5:00 PM UTC. A timezone-aware overview of the next
meeting time can be found [here](https://timee.io/20181010T1700?rf=w&ri=2&rv=3&tl=RustBridge%20Meeting).

Meetings happen over video and audio, using `meet.jit.si`. Our meeting room is [here](http://meet.jit.si/rustbridge).

Every meeting has an agenda which is documented as a GitHub issue in the `rustbridge/team`
repository. You can browse past meeting agendas [here](https://github.com/rustbridge/team/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3AT-meeting+).

Meetings are also sometimes discussed in our [Discord channel](./tools.md#discord). If you want to
start attending our meetings, that's the best place to ask!
