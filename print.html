<p>No matter how you stumbled upon this project, this little page exists to guide
you in the right direction. There's a bit more information depending on what
you're interested in:</p>
<a class="header" href="#i-want-to-attend-a-rustbridge-workshop" id="i-want-to-attend-a-rustbridge-workshop"><h2>I want to attend a RustBridge workshop!</h2></a>
<p>Great! Unfortunately we currently lack a centralized directory of all RustBridge
events happening around the globe (although that would be really nice to have),
so for now your best bet is to have a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/rustbridge/team/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aevent">
issues tagged with <code>event</code></a>, that's generally where all events that
run under the RustBridge name are tracked, but it's not always reliable.
</a></p>
<a class="header" href="#i-want-to-host-my-own-rustbridge-workshop" id="i-want-to-host-my-own-rustbridge-workshop"><h2>I want to host my own RustBridge workshop!</h2></a>
<p>Oh, fantastic! We've prepared a document just for you, you can have a look at it
<a href="./organizing/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#organizing-rustbridge" id="organizing-rustbridge"><h1>Organizing RustBridge</h1></a>
<p>First of all: Welcome to the RustBridge team! We have a very flat hierarchy,
and any person that's interested in organizing is very welcome in our ranks.</p>
<p>That being said, organizing a RustBridge event is much simpler than you might
think. What makes RustBridge events RustBridge events can be boiled down to three points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The event has to be free</li>
<li>The event has to be targeted towards underrepresented minorities in Tech</li>
<li>The event has to follow the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html">Rust Code of Conduct</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But apart from that, you can use any venue, use any curriculum, with as many people
as you want! Although we also provide materials specifically for people who have never
organized a RustBridge event before, so <em>maybe</em> you'd want to check those out...</p>
<a class="header" href="#making-initial-plans" id="making-initial-plans"><h2>Making initial plans</h2></a>
<p>With organizing any event, it's usually good to have an overview of what you want
to accomplish before setting out to do the first steps. That means that you should
be clear <em>where</em>, (roughly) <em>when</em> and <em>with who</em> you want to organize your
event. It's usually better if you have an organizing/teaching team of at least two,
or more depending on the size of your audience. Also if you have a rough date and a
potential venue, it might be good to give them a call before doing anything concrete.</p>
<a class="header" href="#getting-things-scheduled" id="getting-things-scheduled"><h2>Getting things scheduled</h2></a>
<p>First things first, settle on a date. This can be during the work week, but keep
in mind that it's usually an all-day event, so people's capabilities might be limited.
Make sure that nothing else is happening at your chosen date (like a world cup finale
in your city, for example).</p>
<p>After that, probably the most important step is to secure a venue for your date. Try
asking around, be it on Twitter, at meetups, or in other local circles. If you live
in a bigger city, there's usually some companies who would be happy to sponsor the
venue for your event.</p>
<p>Phew, that's the two most important things done! Now's probably the point at which
you should post your meetup in our GitHub issue tracker. If you want to, or if you're
unsure about anything, you can contact us privately before. Once you're ready, post
a new issue in the <a href="https://github.com/rustbridge/team/issues/new">rustbridge/team</a>
GitHub repository. It doesn't have to be an incredibly detailed issue, it just needs the
time and the name of an organizer (maybe you?). A venue is also recommended, but if
you don't have one at this stage, we have ways to help you with that.</p>
<a class="header" href="#getting-people-to-sign-up" id="getting-people-to-sign-up"><h2>Getting people to sign up</h2></a>
<p>Because RustBridge events are aimed towards underrepresented minorities, you might
want to consider not making it a &quot;everyone can come without registration&quot; type of
event. Not only does it make some people feel unwell, but we've had cases in the
past where events got interrupted by third parties with bad intent. For that same reason,
consider <strong>not making the venue location public</strong>, especially if it's a publicly
accessable venue.</p>
<p>In the past, we've usually used a simple Google Forms form for signups to RustBridge
events. This works fairly well, especially if your event is small to medium-scale.
If you need or want more information/help regarding these processes, don't hesitate
to contact us!</p>
<p>If you want to spread the word about your event, we can definitely help you with that.
We have multiple channels over which we can announce your event, so feel free to talk
to us regarding that.</p>
<a class="header" href="#as-the-event-approaches" id="as-the-event-approaches"><h2>As the event approaches</h2></a>
<p>Getting nervous yet? Good, everyone does! Here's a couple of things that you might
want to consider as your event draws closer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Catering. People probably want lunch, so if the venue offers catering, great!
If not, no worries, you can always just tell the group to go and organize lunch
on their own.</li>
<li>Drinks. Some venues have a fridge with drinks, if not, you might
just want to get some water and plastic cups from the local supermarket.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#at-the-event" id="at-the-event"><h2>At the event</h2></a>
<p>On the day of the event, make sure you're at the venue early so you can get everything
set up. Having multiple teachers/mentors is recommended, but depends on the size of
your group. Set yourself a schedule that you'll follow during the day, and be careful
to meet the deadlines imposed by your venue. Other than that, have a great time!</p>
<a class="header" href="#further-questions" id="further-questions"><h2>Further questions</h2></a>
<p>It's unlikely that this document will ever reflect everything that goes into a RustBridge
event, so if you have questions, we'll do our best to help you out.</p>
<p>If you need help from the RustBridge team, we're on the RustBridge Slack, in the #rustbridge
Mozilla IRC channel, in the #rustbridge Rust Discord channel, as well as on GitHub. In
doubt, just open a new issue on <a href="https://github.com/rustbridge/team/issues/new%22">rustbridge/team</a>.</p>
<p>If you need help regarding spreading the word, finding a venue, or finding other
interested people in your area, the Community Team can probably help you with that.
They're on the #rust-community Mozilla IRC channel, as well as
<a href="mailto:community@rust-lang.org">at community@rust-lang.org</a> via email.</p>
<a class="header" href="#rustbridge-team" id="rustbridge-team"><h1>RustBridge Team</h1></a>
<p>The RustBridge team is comprised of individuals who whost RustBridge events,
work on tooling for RustBridge, and people who are just interested in improving
existing conditions under which events are organized.</p>
<p>The team is formally a sub-team of the <a href="https://community.rs">Rust Community Team</a>,
and the current team lead is <a href="https://awoo.su">Olivia Hugger</a>. This means that
RustBridge is fully integrated into the Rust project, which brings with it many
benefits such as cross-cutting team concerns and easier internal communication.</p>
<a class="header" href="#team-meetings" id="team-meetings"><h1>Team Meetings</h1></a>
<p>RustBridge team meetings are nominally held every 2 weeks (alternating with the
Community Team meetings), at 5:00 PM UTC. A timezone-aware overview of the next
meeting time can be found <a href="https://timee.io/20181010T1700?rf=w&amp;ri=2&amp;rv=3&amp;tl=RustBridge%20Meeting">here</a>.</p>
<p>Meetings happen over video and audio, using <code>meet.jit.si</code>. Our meeting room is <a href="http://meet.jit.si/rustbridge">here</a>.</p>
<p>Every meeting has an agenda which is documented as a GitHub issue in the <code>rustbridge/team</code>
repository. You can browse past meeting agendas <a href="https://github.com/rustbridge/team/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3AT-meeting+">here</a>.</p>
<p>Meetings are also sometimes discussed in our <a href="./tools.html#discord">Discord channel</a>. If you want to
start attending our meetings, that's the best place to ask!</p>
<a class="header" href="#team-tooling" id="team-tooling"><h1>Team Tooling</h1></a>
<a class="header" href="#discord" id="discord"><h2>Discord</h2></a>
<p>The main open discussion space for the RustBridge project is in the Rust
project Discord server. Discord is a chat platform that's easy to use
and available on most platforms. You can join the Discord server of the
Rust project by visiting <a href="https://discord.gg/rust-lang">this link</a>.</p>
<p>RustBridge has a channel called <code>#rustbridge</code>, which is categorized under the
&quot;Community&quot; section. If you use the <code>Ctrl/Cmd+K</code> shortcut and search for
RustBridge, you will find it. Feel free to ask questions and hang out!</p>
<a class="header" href="#airtable" id="airtable"><h2>Airtable</h2></a>
<p>Internally, most RustBridge events are centrally planned using <a href="http://airtable.com">Airtable</a>.
This gives us overview and flexibility over which events are happening where.
These sheets are not available to the public, as they contain potentially
private information. They're only visible to RustBridge team members and select
event organizers and teachers.</p>
<a class="header" href="#github" id="github"><h2>GitHub</h2></a>
<p>RustBridge uses GitHub to manage and publicly plan events, as well as develop
infrastructure around the project. Here's some interesting repositories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rustbridge/team">team</a>: This is where the team plans meetings
and publicly announces RustBridge events.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rustbridge/in-a-box">in-a-box</a>: A somewhat complete resource for
RustBridge event organizers needing a curriculum, funding advice, et cetera.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rustbridge/book">book</a>: The source to this book!</li>
