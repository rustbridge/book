<h1 class="f3 f2-m f1-l">Organizing RustBridge</h1>

<p class="measure lh-copy">
  First of all: Welcome to the RustBridge team! We have a very flat hierarchy,
  and any person that's interested in organizing is very welcome in our ranks.
</p>

<p class="measure lh-copy">
  That being said, organizing a RustBridge event is much simpler than you might
  think. What makes RustBridge events RustBridge events can be boiled down to three points:

  <ul>
    <li class="pb2">The event has to be free</li>
    <li class="pb2">The event has to be targeted towards underrepresented minorities in Tech</li>
    <li class="pb2">
      The event has to follow the
      <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html">Rust Code of Conduct</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

</p>

<p class="measure lh-copy">
  But apart from that, you can use any venue, use any curriculum, with as many people
  as you want! Although we also provide materials specifically for people who have never
  organized a RustBridge event before, so <i>maybe</i> you'd want to check those out...
</p>

<h2 class="f4 f3-m f2-l">Making initial plans</h2>

<p class="measure lh-copy">
  With organizing any event, it's usually good to have an overview of what you want
  to accomplish before setting out to do the first steps. That means that you should
  be clear <i>where</i>, (roughly) <i>when</i> and <i>with who</i> you want to organize your
  event. It's usually better if you have an organizing/teaching team of at least two,
  or more depending on the size of your audience. Also if you have a rough date and a
  potential venue, it might be good to give them a call before doing anything concrete.
</p>

<h2 class="f4 f3-m f2-l">Getting things scheduled</h2>

<p class="measure lh-copy">
  First things first, settle on a date. This can be during the work week, but keep
  in mind that it's usually an all-day event, so people's capabilities might be limited.
  Make sure that nothing else is happening at your chosen date (like a world cup finale
  in your city, for example).
</p>

<p class="measure lh-copy">
  After that, probably the most important step is to secure a venue for your date. Try
  asking around, be it on Twitter, at meetups, or in other local circles. If you live
  in a bigger city, there's usually some companies who would be happy to sponsor the
  venue for your event.
</p>

<p class="measure lh-copy">
  Phew, that's the two most important things done! Now's probably the point at which
  you should post your meetup in our GitHub issue tracker. If you want to, or if you're
  unsure about anything, you can contact us privately before. Once you're ready, post
  a new issue in the
  <a class="link dim blue" href="https://github.com/rustbridge/team/issues/new">rustbridge/team</a>
  GitHub repository. It doesn't have to be an incredibly detailed issue, it just needs the
  time and the name of an organizer (maybe you?). A venue is also recommended, but if
  you don't have one at this stage, we have ways to help you with that.
</p>

<h2 class="f4 f3-m f2-l">Getting people to sign up</h2>

<p class="measure lh-copy">
  Because RustBridge events are aimed towards underrepresented minorities, you might
  want to consider not making it a "everyone can come without registration" type of
  event. Not only does it make some people feel unwell, but we've had cases in the
  past where events got interrupted by third parties with bad intent. For that same reason,
  consider <b>not making the venue location public</b>, especially if it's a publicly
  accessable venue.
</p>

<p class="measure lh-copy">
  In the past, we've usually used a simple Google Forms form for signups to RustBridge
  events. This works fairly well, especially if your event is small to medium-scale.
  If you need or want more information/help regarding these processes, don't hesitate
  to contact us!
</p>

<p class="measure lh-copy">
  If you want to spread the word about your event, we can definitely help you with that.
  We have multiple channels over which we can announce your event, so feel free to talk
  to us regarding that.
</p>

<h2 class="f4 f3-m f2-l">As the event approaches</h2>

<p class="measure lh-copy">
  Getting nervous yet? Good, everyone does! Here's a couple of things that you might
  want to consider as your event draws closer:

  <ul>
    <li class="pb2 lh-copy measure">
      Catering. People probably want lunch, so if the venue offers catering, great!
      If not, no worries, you can always just tell the group to go and organize lunch
      on their own.
    </li>
    <li class="pb2 lh-copy measure">
      Drinks. Some venues have a fridge with drinks, if not, you might
      just want to get some water and plastic cups from the local supermarket.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2 class="f4 f3-m f2-l">At the event</h2>

<p class="measure lh-copy">
  On the day of the event, make sure you're at the venue early so you can get everything
  set up. Having multiple teachers/mentors is recommended, but depends on the size of
  your group. Set yourself a schedule that you'll follow during the day, and be careful
  to meet the deadlines imposed by your venue. Other than that, have a great time!
</p>

<h2 class="f4 f3-m f2-l">Further questions</h2>

<p class="measure lh-copy">
  It's unlikely that this document will ever reflect everything that goes into a RustBridge
  event, so if you have questions, we'll do our best to help you out.
